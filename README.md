# Music-Player

This music player is basically made from  HTML
 CSS and  Javascript... It basically works with 
Javascript. But a few styling is made to make it
Look better. So the languages used are #CSS and #SCSS


# How It Works 

The music player works through the functions() and 
If Javascript codes. In beginning we declare some 
Variables with help of #const tag. Which helps us in
Setting the functions easily and with more convience.


# Is Styling Important

No, but a layout and design make a thing look prettier
Than simple one...

I would prefer a CSS or SCSS styling if you are making
This as a team project.


# How To Add More Songs

For adding more songs into the player visit the 
#musiclist.js file and #addmusic.md file. However 
the steps are very easy...

```sh
{
    Name: "Name of song",
    Artist: "Singer of song",
    Img: "*",
    Src: "*"
}
```

Here * refers to:-

Song no. + .MP3/. jpg

It means that you have to sequence the songs and 
Let's suppose song name is ABC artist is XYZ and 
Song no. Is 3. Then code will be

```sh
{
    Name: "ABC",
    Artist: "XYZ",
    Img: "music-2",
    Src: "music-2"
}
